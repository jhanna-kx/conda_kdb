kdb+ on demand - Personal Edition

kdb+ on demand 64 bit personal edition is for personal, non-commercial use. It may be used freely on up to 2 computers, and up to a maximum of 16 cores per computer, but is not licensed for use on any cloud, only personal computers.

Details on the information sent in these packets are fully detailed in the license below. No other information is sent. No information received by Kx will ever be shared with any third party, and will not be used for any purposes other than license management.
